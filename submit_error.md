Failed Test: 7. Test functionality of AlphaBetaPlayer.alphabeta()
----------------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError: Failed to cut off search -- expanded too many nodes. (i.e., your agent did not prune at this node, but a correct alpha beta search did prune at this node when following the same expansion order that your agent followed.)
Alpha: 5.0
Beta: 5.0
Game tree evaluation order:
[(1, 4), (1, 6), (2, 7), (4, 7), (5, 4), (5, 6)]
[(5, 7), (7, 3), (7, 7)]

Nodes are shown with each layer sorted in the order the nodes were expanded
during search.  All nodes in each successive layer are children of the
furthest-right node in the parent layer above it.
