good question:
iterative deeping;
how to analysis heuristic:
    - Which heuristic do you think goes much deeper?
    - How easy is your heuristic ?
    - Which of your heuristics performs better and why?
    - the min/max/mean depth in running
    - the trade-off between depth and complexity for calculating.
need to do:
    - alpha-beta need to be understood more precisely
    - more code should be done to explore the algorithm and heuristics.
